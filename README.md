# CA04-Ensemble-Models

This assignment uses the same data souce as the one used for CA03 - Decision-Tree-Algorithm. 
The dataset is obtained from the Census Bureau and represents salaries of people 
along with seven demographic variables. The following is a description of our dataset: 


â€¢ Number of target classes: 2 ('>50K' and '<=50K') [ Labels: 1, 0 ] 

â€¢ Number of attributes (Columns): 7 

â€¢ Number of instances (Rows): 48,842 


**Installation**

Be aready to mount the drive from Google Drive: 

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/gdrive')

In order for the program to run properly, make sure your csv files are located in paths as follows:
For example:
'/gdrive/MyDrive/BSAN6070/CA03/census_data.csv'

**Usage**

Use census data to build four ensemble models (Random Forest, Ada Boost, Gradient Boost, XGB) to determine the optimal value for the highest accuracy. 

**Contributing**

Revisions and updates are welcomed.

Please update python commands as appropriate.
